            <h3>C# / .Net</h3>
            <h4 class="text-justify">
              C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# and .NET are typically used by larger enterprises, government agencies, and companies serving enterprise and government clients. Portland companies using C# and .NET who have hired Epicodus graduates include Windsor and Incomm.

            <h3>Java / Android</h3>
            <h4 class="text-justify">
              Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has very been popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn.<br>
              Android development is used in everything from phones to tablets to watches, and companies hiring Android developers range from small startups to giant enterprises.

            <h3>PHP / Drupal</h3>
            <h4 class="text-justify">
              PHP is most used in content-heavy websites with relatively little user interaction. The most popular content management systems - Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla - are all written in PHP, and everything from local restaurants' websites up through large complex government deployments are built with these tools. If you're keen to work for an agency that builds websites for clients, or if you like the idea of building out sites for brands, businesses, and organizations, PHP is a great direction to go.<br>
              PHP and Drupal are typically used to build content-focused websites. Portland companies using PHP and Drupal who have hired Epicodus graduates include Intel, Metal Toad, and OpenSesame.

            <h3>Ruby / Rails</h3>
            <h4 class="text-justify">
              Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. Ruby and Rails are typically used by younger companies and startups. Portland companies using Ruby and Rails who have hired Epicodus graduates include New Relic, LivingSocial, and SpendWell.

            <h3>CSS / Design</h3>
            <h4 class="text-justify">
              CSS is one of the core languages of the web and is an integral part of front-end development. CSS – along with HTML and JavaScript – helps front-end developers control what the end user of a website can see and do. In a world dominated by big brands and big ideas, the need for skilled designers is greater than ever. Whether you’re an aspiring freelancer, a design-savvy front-end developer, or a budding UI/UX designer, this course is a launching point for anyone interested in designing beautiful, memorable web experiences.
